      <li>Many of the links that Lialina included that I clicked on led to websites that didn't exist anymore, which seems representative of her point that the web is constantly changing.</li>

      <li>"Animated gifs will not be forgotten and at Christmas Jingle Bells and Celine Dion in MIDI format will be ringing on sites around the world"</li>

      <li>The opening of this article describes an Internet more like the Internet of today, and it makes it seem like the way the Internet was used changed completely between 2005 and 2007. Did it really change that much?</li>
      <br>
      <li>I had never heard of iGoogle until reading this article.</li>
      <br>
      <li>The first addition at the bottom of the article about the difference between Facebook and MySpace shows how much attitudes toward Facebook have changed in the last twelve years.</li>
