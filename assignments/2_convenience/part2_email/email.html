  <p>Hi Dr. Faison,</p>
  <p>Just wanted to let you know that I had my presentation for ASTR 255 last week, and it went really well! I really appreciate all the help and guidance you gave me along the way; it was invaluable. As you might have guessed, I was a bit rushed at the end, but I'm very happy with how the poster (which I've attached as a Powerpoint file and as a PDF) turned out. I haven't quite finished making that checklist I mentioned in one of our last meetings, but I'll send you that as soon as I finish, probably in the next couple days!</p>
  <p>Thanks again, <br> Robert</p>
